# PC_Crawler
## A simple Python way to browse through files and folders
Run PC_Crawler to create the data files for Script.pyw.
Run Script.
* The script currently only scans the F drive. Edit to traverse through others.
* Press ">>>>" followed by file/folder name then "<" to open the file/folder. Press anywhere on any screen to run.
* Conflicts in file/folder name are also covered.
* The system also works as a keylogger for your device. Find text files in the directory to check logs.
